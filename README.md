# Gadolinium
Analysing the experimental data of the spontaneous temperature and magnetisation of the Gadolinium in comparison to the test data of various curves of magnetic momentums to find which is the angular momentum of the Gd3+. Theoricaly we know it must be J=7/2. <br />
For that, we use first the Curve Fitting method and then a Regression Analysis of the experimental and test data.
